          </div>
          <div class="campus-text">
            <p>The firm Steven Holl Architects is developing plans for a comprehensive project to create a new building for 20th- and 21st-century art and a new facility for the Glassell School of Art; those structures will link to the existing gallery builings by Ludwig Miles van der Rohe and Rafael Moneo, as well as the sculpture garden by Isamu Nofuchi, establishing a 14-acre public campus in the heart of Houston's Museum District.</p>

        <h2>Alfred C. Glassell School of Art</h2>
        <img src="mfah-glassell-school-of-art.jpg"/>
        <p><strong>Architect: Eugene Aubry of S. I. Morris and Associates<br/>Director: William C. Agee<br/>Year: 1979</strong><br/><br/>By the mid-1970s, the Museum needed a new facility for its school of art to accommodate the growing student body. Under the guidance of Museum director William C. Agee, and with a generous donation from Alfred Glassell, Jr., a plan for an approximately 42,000-square-foot building was drawn up by architects Eugene Aubry and R. Nolen Willis of the prominent Houston firm S. I. Morris and Associates. The building—a two-story space made from concrete and glass-block, and located one block north of the Museum—represented the first time that the school had a home of its own in its 52-year history. The Glassell School of Art opened to the public on January 13, 1979.</p>
